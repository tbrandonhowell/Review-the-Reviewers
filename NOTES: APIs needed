** comments should be stored in an array so that they can be identified by their position for API usage

Get routes:
/ << displays all results from database, sorted by date added (can build out pagination later, if desired)
/review/{_id} << shows the comments for the article

Post routes:
/api/comment/{_id} << for new comment
/api/comDelete/{_id}/{comment}
